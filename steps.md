## SECTION 1: Breadboard Power Distribution

### Step 1: Understanding Your Power Supply Module

Your breadboard power supply module typically has:

- **2x 3.3V pins** (usually labeled "3.3V" or "3V3")
- **2x 5V pins** (usually labeled "5V" or "VCC")
- **4x GND pins** (usually labeled "GND" or "-")
- **Power input** (barrel jack or screw terminals)
- **Power switch** and **voltage selection jumpers**

### Step 2: Configure Power Supply Module

- **Set voltage jumpers** to 3.3V position (check module documentation)
- **Connect power adapter** to module's input (usually 7-12V DC)
- **Turn on power switch** - LED indicators should light up
- **Verify 3.3V output** with multimeter if available

### Step 3: Mount Power Supply Module

- **Insert module** onto Breadboard 1 (usually fits on the side rails)
- **Alternative**: Place module next to breadboards if it doesn't fit

### Step 4: Connect Power Supply to Breadboards

- **3.3V Distribution**:

  - Use **red jumper wires** from **both 3.3V pins** on module to red power rails
  - Connect **Breadboard 1 red rail** to one 3.3V pin
  - Connect **Breadboard 2 red rail** to other 3.3V pin
  - Use **red jumper wire** to connect Breadboard 3 red rail to Breadboard 1 or 2

- **Ground Distribution**:
  - Use **black jumper wires** from **GND pins** on module to blue ground rails
  - Connect all 3 breadboard blue rails together
  - Use 2-3 GND pins from module for solid ground connections

### Step 5: Connect Pi Ground to Breadboard System

- **Common Ground**: **Male-to-female jumper wire** from Pi **GND (Pin 6)** to any blue ground rail
- **Purpose**: Creates common ground reference between Pi and breadboard circuits
- **Important**: This is the ONLY power-related connection between Pi and breadboards

## Troubleshooting Common Wiring Issues

### LEDs Don't Light Up

- **Check LED polarity**: Long leg = anode = positive side
- **Verify 330Œ© resistors** are in the circuit
- **Confirm ground connections** to blue ground rail
- **Test with multimeter**: Should read ~3.3V from anode to ground

### Button Doesn't Respond

- **Check 4-pin button orientation** across center gap
- **Verify 10kŒ© pull-down resistor** placement
- **Confirm GPIO 2 connection** from Pi Pin 3
- **Test button continuity** with multimeter

### Power Issues

- **Ensure Pi 3.3V** connects to red power rail
- **Check all ground connections** to blue ground rail
- **Verify breadboard interconnections** (rail-to-rail jumpers)
- **Measure voltage**: Should read 3.3V on power rails

### Pi Won't Boot

- **Check power supply** (proper Pi power adapter)
- **Verify no short circuits** between 3.3V and ground
- **Remove all connections** and test Pi alone first

## Testing Individual Components

### Test LEDs Individually

```bash
# Test Red LED
python3 -c "from gpiozero import LED; led=LED(18); led.on(); input('Press Enter'); led.off()"

# Test Green LED
python3 -c "from gpiozero import LED; led=LED(24); led.on(); input('Press Enter'); led.off()"

# Test Blue LED
python3 -c "from gpiozero import LED; led=LED(25); led.on(); input('Press Enter'); led.off()"
```

### Test Button

```bash
# Test Button (press button while running)
python3 -c "from gpiozero import Button; btn=Button(2); print('Press button...'); btn.wait_for_press(); print('Button pressed!')"
```
