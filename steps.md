## SECTION 5: Connection Verification

### Step 11: Power System Check

1. **Visual Inspection**: Verify all power rails are connected (red-to-red, blue-to-blue)

## Expected Behavior After Wiring

- All LEDs should be OFF when ESP32 is powered (before code upload)
- Button should have no effect until Arduino code is uploaded
- ESP32 built-in LED may blink during programming
- No smoke, sparks, or heat indicates successful wiring

## Troubleshooting Common Wiring Issues

### LEDs Don't Light Up

- Check LED polarity (long leg = anode = positive)
- Verify 330Î© resistors are in circuit
- Confirm ground connections

### Button Doesn't Respond

- Check 4-pin button orientation
- Verify 10kÎ© pull-down resistor placement
- Confirm GPIO 4 connection

### Power Issues

- Ensure ESP32 3.3V connects to red power rail
- Check all ground connections to blue ground rail
- Verify breadboard interconnections
